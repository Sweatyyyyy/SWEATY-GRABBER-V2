Hello, User

If you're reading this that likely means you've been infected with the Septic WormX client. 

             ----------------------------------------------------------
All of your files have been encrypted using the RSA encryption algorithm, and the key to decrypt them is being stored securely on my webserver. 

You don't have to pay, in fact if you'd like you can just remove the virus, or format your drive, but your files will remain encrypted

If you'd like to have your files recovered send $550 USD to my Monero(XMR) address: 

Once the payment has been sent your files will automatically be restored and the virus uninstalled from your computer's memory.
